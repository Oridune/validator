# Getting started

## Introduction

Oridune validator is a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library like Zod.

Validator is designed to be as developer-friendly as possible. The goal is to eliminate duplicative type declarations. With Validator, you declare a validator schema once and it will automatically infer the static TypeScript type. It's easy to compose simpler types into complex data structures.

* Zero dependencies
* Works in Deno/Node and all modern browsers
* Reusable schema that leverages the validation context to save the memory
* Concise, chainable interface
* It works with plain JavaScript too! You don't need to use TypeScript.

### Requirements <a href="#requirements" id="requirements"></a>

* TypeScript 4.5+!
* You must enable `strict` mode in your `tsconfig.json`. This is a best practice for all TypeScript projects.

### Installation

You can install the Oridune validator from JSR in your preferred JavaScript environment! See the following [link for the installation](https://jsr.io/@oridune/validator)
